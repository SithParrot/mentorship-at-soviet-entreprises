# mentorship-at-soviet-entreprises
This is the number of mentors at Soviet enterprises in the regions of the RSFSR and the republics of the USSR in 1984-1989. 
Statistics are taken from GARF, collection R5451, inventory 25b, d.3390, 3426, 3504, 3538. These statistics were collected by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; before 1984, statistics were collected by industry, so only a small part of the statistics is provided here.
